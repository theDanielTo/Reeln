# Reel'n
#### A fishing tournament app for anyone who loves fishing and anyone who wants to see how they fare against other anglers.
#### A fully-responsive full-stack web app for creating invitational or public fishing competitions created with React.js and Node.js supplemented with Express.

- Designed and built a fully responsive client-side React.js components while managing URL paths with hash routing.
- Included multer as a file upload middleware to store and handle image files uploaded by users.
- Relayed client to server requests via Node.js and Express.js in order to update the PostgreSQL database field/value pairs.
- Integrated user authentication with argon2 to allow persisting user sessions and saving user data in a JSON web token.

## Why I wanted to build this project

A couple of friends and I would have annual fishing competitions where the one who found and caught the most amount of species of fish would win. The losers would pay for the upcoming year's fishing license for the winner! We would keep track of what was caught during the year on a piece of paper (which would get totally destroyed when we would carry it around with us and dropping it into water :joy:). I figured this would be the perfect alternative for the piece of paper, and at the same time, open this little game up for anyone else to enjoy!
